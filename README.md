# Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Fusion Approach for Predicting Acute Dermal Toxicity
This work mainly focused on deep learning-based multimodal fusion approach to predict Acute Dermal Toxicity (ADT). The research integrates three different feature representations:
* Image-based (spatial) features
* SMILES-based (sequential) features
* Fingerprint-based (structural) features

These features are concatenated and fed into a deep neural network to predict ADT. This deep learning-based multimodal fusion approaches outperformed existing methods in the literature.
