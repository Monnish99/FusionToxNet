# Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Fusion Approach for Predicting Acute Dermal Toxicity
This work mainly focused on deep learning-based multimodal fusion approach to predict Acute Dermal Toxicity (ADT). The research integrates three different feature representations:
\begin{itemize}
\item vdjbvjsbv
\end{itemize}



Some machine learning models were also applied in addition to the deep learning models. But, the deep learning-based multimodal fusion approaches outperformed the existing works on the literature.
